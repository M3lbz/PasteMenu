# PasteMenu

PasteMenu is an AutoHotKey script that allows you to set up a local PasteBin that is accessible via a menu triggered by a keyboard shortcut.

By default the menu trigger is `ctrl + alt + V`

## Installation

Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) on your machine

Pull down the Repo and double click the .ahkfile

## Usage

In the same folder as the .ahk file create txt files where the Name is the text in the menu and the content is what you want to paste.

Be sure to change the extension to .paste as that's what the script looks for to create the menu
